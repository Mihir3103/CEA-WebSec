              <p> My name is Mihir Borse. I like to learn new things. Particularly things that I may have to apply some time after learning or even while learning it. Just learning things and not applying them is not something that I prefer. My hobbies include playing football and athletics. I am finding web development to be quite the interesting field. It is also very vast as there is always something new to learn. Apart from being a future job prospect, I think that it is also very fascinating as a hobby. I also like taking part in team events or working as a team in general. </p>

            <p>
                I do love to learn and I think that for web development in particular, practice is learning. Being a CEA web secretary gives a platform to learn different skills. Time management and teamwork are the two I’m looking forward to the most, apart from web-dev of course. Another motivating factor I think is the chance to become a part of a framework much bigger than myself (or any individual). Knowing that the work I do is not just for myself but contributes to the overall working of a group is something that will keep me motivated for sure. Also, I don’t want to let go such golden opportunities. Unfortunately, I wasted a lot of time in the online sem. I don’t plan to miss any chances any more. I suppose I can’t be a fresher forever.

            </h1>
            <p>
                To be completely honest, I only started web development a week back. Though my experience in web-dev is close to void, I chose to apply for this post to learn more about it. I am excited about the post and the field. My aim is to actually gain experience in the field and I want this post to be the foundation for it. Not sure if its worth mentioning, but I was taught HTML in school. But now that I see the vastness of this field, that was just the tip of the iceberg.
